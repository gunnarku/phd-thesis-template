\chapter{Content Chapters}% paper title
\label{c2}

\begin{chapterabstract}
    The abstract of you paper goes here.
\end{chapterabstract}


\section{Paper Sections}% sections as in the paper
\label{sec:c2:intro}% hierarchical labels avoid clashes between chapters

In each of the content chapters:

\begin{itemize}
    \item If chapters are included as the original publications,
    you can put the ``published as'' note. If you have made some changes
    (e.g. removing background section because it has already been included
    in a previous chapter or removing future work), you can use ``Based on.''
    If chapters contain two or more papers then you can say
    something like ``Parts of this chapter are based on \dots'' or
    ``Parts of this chapter have been published as.'' Subsequently,
    abstracts and sections should be merged. If a chapter expands on
    a published short paper (e.g. that originates from a long paper
    which was accepted as short) the note should again be ``Based on.''
    
    \item Make the whole work coherent:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Remove redundant text from the introduction. Note that
        redundancies in other sections (e.g. Related Work) can be kept
        as they are often used to compare to the work presented
        in the current chapter.
        \item Have a common set of references for the whole thesis.
        Merge `.bib' entries with different keys containing details
        for the same reference.
    \end{itemize}

    \item Expressions that refer to the papers per se like ``in this paper''
    should be adjusted towards the thesis e.g. ``in this chapter.''

    \item The acknowledgments to people (but not to funding sources)
    from original papers can remain at each chapter.
    
    \item References to own publications that are also part of the thesis
    should be replaced by references to the respective chapters in the thesis
    (note: this does not hold for the introduction).

    \item Particularly in chapters containing papers that were published
    early in the PhD project it may make sense to add additional references
    and remarks pointing to other chapters.
    
    \item The conclusions/future work sub-section should be limited
    to conclusions, i.e. future work should not appear here.
    Here is what you do with future work:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Future work that has already been completed and reported
        in other chapters should point to those chapters, e.g.
        ``The framework that is reported in this chapter has been extended
        with an additional viewpoint that relates decisions to forces
        (see Chapter N)''.
        \item Future work that is uncompleted should be moved
        to the conclusions chapter of the thesis, together with
        that of the rest of the content chapters
        (see notes on the conclusion chapter).
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item It is advisable at the very end of the chapter to include a segue
    for the next chapter, e.g. ``In this chapter we learned X,
    so it is natural to ask Y in the next chapter.''
    
    \item Particularly for conference papers, the authors usually get
    additional feedback after the paper presentations,
    which could not be considered in the paper version for the proceedings.
    It is a good practice to work on this feedback and revise the papers
    accordingly in the thesis.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Appendices}

The appendices of all chapters should be moved to the end of the thesis.
This increases the readability of the main body of the thesis.
You can also separate appendices according to the chapter they originated from
(e.g. appendices 1--5 belong to chapter 3
while appendices 6--8 belong to chapter 5).

\noindent
\textbf{References}

When merging the references for the thesis,
make sure you do not create duplicated references
by citing the same source using different bibtex keys
(this is a VERY common mistake). Also, make sure that
\begin{itemize}
    \item the references are complete and correct,
    \item all papers or books are referenced in the latest edition
          in all chapters, and
    \item all internet sources are still available.
\end{itemize}
