\chapter{Conclusion Chapter}
\label{c9}

The conclusion chapter is the last regular chapter,
i.e. right before the appendices (if any).

\section{Guidelines for the Conclusion}
\label{sec:c9:structure}

The conclusions chapter should be structured as follows:
\begin{description}
	\item [Answers to research questions] Here you will revisit the RQs
	that you elaborated in the problem decomposition. While in the latter,
	you had focused on the RQs and describing the problem,
	here you will simply repeat the question and focus on the solutions
	and answers you gave. It is still advisable to again briefly link
	each question to the previous.
	
	\item [Contributions] Here you describe the contributions of the thesis,
	i.e. what the thesis adds beyond the state of the art.
	
	\item [Future work] Since this is mostly a collection of
	(uncompleted) future work from the content chapters,
	it helps to reduce redundancy and make them all up-to-date
	(some future work sections of earlier papers
	tend to be superseded by more recent papers).
	
	\item [Discussion] This section includes
	\begin{itemize}
		\item reflection on the contributions;
		\item limitations of the contributions;
		\item links to related fields; and
		\item a forecast of the future.
	\end{itemize}
\end{description}
